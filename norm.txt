a book other than the operating india operating order book of over hundred and ten megawatts and
a cold block in micro tech three and there is you have got the listing order for  not
a favorable order from td sat on the on the existing contract and i
a large amount to the to the to the to the third countries could you please specify which
account of improved on pm basis coming on commercial mining the company is now having
achieved we know certificate so it is up and running and is moving to commercial production similarly all the ancillary
adani digital lab and shared services center apex for the sustained long term value
adani enterprise person concern it's the pioneer on mb with its mined developer concept in india with an integrated
ael has made significant progress in our attractive incubation pipeline this was quarter of financial
airport portfolio is performing as expected the number
and a update on the engine wafer and other facilities on the integrated manufacturing in the after the half half yearly
and also we already got the completion of eac committee for 
and and the related question is that in the segment in the segment to say
and in in majority the case then ancillary system is is operating we expect the 
and not so two aspects contributing to the growth in ebita
and secondly the increasing in the actual gross spend rate of each of the percent
and we will be and and and the and the we expect the
and we've been in a position to update over the next six to nine months so so from in the ancillary and product system also
any problem we are being better than what we did last year as you've seen that quarter one
anyone wishing to ask a question may please press star and one attached telephone
are we have to do ten million ton but we on the request of nlc who is our customer
as like i said in my opening comment the backward integration is continuing so wafer and engine plant is
as you know aes business portfolio comprises both established and incubating assets spread across
asking the question is what production has fallen like ten percent y y so
at twenty five thousand eight hundred and ten crore consolidated ebita increased by forty seven percent year on year to
be the capex on airport will broadly remain in that range for the next years and then
beat glass b aluminum frame back sheet eva all of that are now now in very advanced stages
by forty four percent to six hundred and seventy four crore in our commitment of having
can i please over to
capex plan so don't alter for for the asset like green hydrogen three million
commercial blocks blocks allocated  in the state of maharastra chattisgarh madhya pradesh jharkhand

development and we'll formally update as to where it is in in our half year result win fintech facility as i said has already
director enterprises and ceo  natural resources mister robbie singh cfo
do you consider as our biggest competitive advantage versus appears we we don't specify
during quarter in that wafer facility preliminary work has commenced and we will update at the half year
ecosystem and the incubating business performance the consolidated total income was
facility approximately fifty billion dollars as we outlined earlier previously year
fc fc tail the phase two and as as soon as we get stage two we should be pushing to
fertilizer green fertilizer everything is on that sense at at at full speed in that
for voice phone so as for your first question is about the commercial mind we
from icici securities please go ahead yeah good evening sir and thanks for
gpu it'll take some time because out of seven four are actually underground mine so they'll take some
green had an ecosystem during the quarter the integrated manufacturing division received the professional certificate for five point two
grew twenty seven percent and is now tracking at eighty five million a year with this quarter number being close to twenty one point three million
having the prc of twenty two million per annum for this financial year as per contextual obligation we
hi sir so could you share some details on the progress of creating green hydrogen ecosystem
hydrogen a post data center segments for the next three years overall there the longer term
i understand that we have the four giga watt solar module capacity but just want to understand how we looking
i welcome you all to the earnings calls to discuss first quarter financial twenty four results 
i will provide that update in the second half with the second half results the other element of it which is which you
identified and site work site evaluation site work jio tech and all all of that is going on
in manufacturing the road transport team won energy conservation award gold category in the road construction
in terms of the other business integrated resource management business we have continuing to develop business and shared with the diversified
in the journey of ael our est plus  embedded
in the road portfolio construction is in full swing in our ten m and board projects 
in this financial year we are to just start we should start one mine as far as the mine option is concerned
ing infrastructure mining verification on site and the transportation to be consumption
is that you understanding correct yes yes sir understand sir
it trend over there so as far as the dc
it volumes and when mine the talabira
just about between three hundred million to four hundred million and then it rapidly
just wanted to understand what would be the proportion of overall capacity that has been formed up with
ladies and gentlemen good day and welcome to adani enterprises limited q one fy twenty four earning
ladies and gentlemen we will wait for a moment while the question
last in the quarter q q the largely the ebita growth and ebita is driven by the
line the green hydrogen ecosystem we won the aegis grand bell in the category
lines will be in listen only mode and in there be an opportunity for you to questions after presentation
look at you know it's like it's sometimes it gets you know i would say i guess too much on what's the what's the competitive advantage
lost and that is one of the key aspects of the regulatory business understood sir
madheri kulanda and gandera ujani code block by moc in june twenty three
megawatt prototype one wind turbine the production of this is expected during this quarter further
mining i don't think we you at me volume this year's in india okay so and
mister saurav shah finance controller and mister manan bakaria investor relations 
now for update of some of our incubating businesses 
now i'll hand over to my colleague vinay prakash who will take you through the mining services and the iron business highlights vinay over to
of hyper scalers and we expect that to rise dramatically over the next couple of years
of the regulatory process the time value of money is always accounted for in the regulatory order so if
okay my last question is there on on the on the solar t v we have done
okay sir my third question is for car michael is it possible to share the waiver that ebita for the quarter
okay sir that that would be point so on the data center business
on technology sharing for electroliser no all of that is
one giga watt of data center platform in india i'm pleased to inform you that adani connects has secured the largest data center project financing
order generally as a rule from a regulator applies only to the
out of these three projects have more than fifty percent completed construction and the rest the projects are as scheduled
participants are requested to use handsets while asksing a question
percent of ebita our performance for the quarter reflects our strong operational momentum on the back of pan
players okay we would like to be one of the leading players and
pleased to host the senior management team of adani enterprises today we have with us mister vined prakash 
point which is tps the company is empty for eight code blocks and two inr blocks
pool service data center okay and the various aspect called the center edge
pressing star please note that this conference has been
primarily us europe overall
queueif you wish to remove yourself from question queue you may press star and two
recorded i now hand the conference over to mister aditya bhartia from invest capital
refer to being the electrolisers there yes we we all the agreements in relation to the three technologies are in place
regulatory we don't want to specifiy the comment on time because there's a lot of these relatively
rupees to a dollar rate but adjust for that but so about one point one billion us dollar this
second question is that a sa mumbai airport the airport ebita q q
see that all the volume which is going out of our mind are getting loaded to the ships so that there we're not seeing
segment which is disclosed commercial mining is is one line item i believe this primarly corresponds to car cycles
services thank you and over to you sir thank you listen you
seventeen point eight million metric ton and ebita for the quarter one has increased to be one thousand crore
should need assistance during the conference call please signal an operator
so i got the first tell of i'm not getting getting able to get the talk
so is this primary on arrow or do have you seen these pending
so that plan continues afford as it is which will be
so what is the off take over there and also the ebit has been negative so what should we what we
so whatever we mining we are able to sell it in different countries
sometimes we towards the end of the the the this quarter or early the third quarter to start
specific order that is sort by the asset owner however from the prescedence point of view you are correct
star and one to ask a question
start sizing from next year and the year after on the airport side we will have about
stood at rupees six hundred and eight crore and ebita at rupees two forty two crore
sure sir that's take sir thank you so much thank you
thank you before we take the next question like to remind participants that you may
thank you ladies and gentlemen we will now begin with the question and answer session
thank you sir so thanks for the opportunity and congrats on a good set of numbers so
thank you so much
thank you we open to q and a
that in the filing of mile also the similar considerations
that's the strength of adani group we have we have been in this business of ic for last twenty twenty four
the commercial mine in this financial year we have already got the ec permission we are hopeful to get both
the countries with familiar we were exporting our bottles right now some ballpark
the first question is from the line of mohit kumar
the next question is from the line of aditya bhartia from investec capital please go ahead
the next question is from the line of nikhil abhiyankar from icici securities please go ahead
the opportunity my first question is on the mumbai airport i believe that gmr has got
the timelines for the expansion of this facility as well as proper integration also has there been any progress
the well service range type from seeking various approvals land accretion inr develpo
the work is underway site evaluation versus you know b methanol b pneumonia
then the land for this for the solar wind plants have been
there is no change the timeline as we had indicated last year but i think from a formally full detailed timeline on green hydrogen the best
there's a delay or if they it takes some time to validate that will be captured in the final order so there is no economic value
they would be a decline once we complete the first phase of our development plan in airports
think that this call this particular order should be applicable to  mumbai airport is my understanding right
thirteen okay sir and so we have you have given the production for car michael mine
this year just about one point one billion us dollars all of these just to clarify i we are assuming eighty
time to to go for the preparation you have to prepare for sharp incline and then if
time to update will be may next year but certainly on on the engine wafer and further
to maintain leadership position going forward the volume in quarter one f y twenty four is stood at
to put machine to take out cores so that will they take time up uptill twenty twety five to twenty twenty six but
to the fundamental plan with the significant amount of capex going into our green hydrogen business and other businesses of similar nature
twenty four is powered by the emergence of green hydrogen business adani new industry limited that now contributes over ten
twenty three with the one point three  double in this year by doing two point six 
two aspects one the spending by the passengers and one percentage are there
two projects are located in the state of chattisgarh mp and orrisa the company had
two thousand eight hundred and ninety six crore  and in line with the increased ebita consolidated pat increased
ugly hopeful of starting the open third in the ruby mine which is
understood sir and lastly so what are of capex plans especially for green
understood the customer that's it from my side thank you
utility transport and direct to consumer can primary industries in services ael includes 
vertical we will provide a comprehensive update to with the with final year result
very good job in the sense the numbers are are are are are are very good for the quarter and i believe
volume added for for the call mining volume yes sorry
was not india is going be very significant data market and we will have lot more than just one or two
we are also developing tall in mines so what is the how much do we expect per year out
we have indicated that all engines will be testing thirteen million term this year one three
we start the call with opening remarks from mister robbie saying post which we move to q and a thank you and over to you sir
we will be well on the way to completing one giga watt by before the end of this decade
what the guidance for commercial mining this year and what exactly the the reason
which showed so this year we would touch about
will apply this understood but it will take time to to get resolved
will come only the next case okay and so what is the guidance for this year so what
with is contract and the country delivered during the quarter what as per the schedule the quarter the revenue 
with the box cutting mine all other mines be bi john or grand or
with the orders already and if you look at this this this segment what would be up on
yeah certain awards that highlight the consistent endeavor and those include
yeah what is the time expectation when you think you know this new thing can get reinterpreted and be part
years so we have a good setup in many countries and that's how in the first year second year itself we are in position to
you know our our our higher tariff no that is i think important thing to realize
you thanks for please all i first
you're talking about the coal binding volume yes sir coal my commercial mining volume yes yes so commercial

37,C:\Users\deepanshunirvan\Desktop\Deepanshu\DistrictD\DemoData\audio\audio_1696249517_132.wav,224042,of hyper scalers and we expect that to rise dramatically over the next couple of years
38,C:\Users\deepanshunirvan\Desktop\Deepanshu\DistrictD\DemoData\audio\audio_1696249517_133.wav,224042,we will be well on the way to completing one giga watt by before the end of this decade
39,C:\Users\deepanshunirvan\Desktop\Deepanshu\DistrictD\DemoData\audio\audio_1696249517_134.wav,224042,understood sir and lastly so what are of capex plans especially for green
40,C:\Users\deepanshunirvan\Desktop\Deepanshu\DistrictD\DemoData\audio\audio_1696249517_135.wav,224042,hydrogen a post data center segments for the next three years overall there the longer term
41,C:\Users\deepanshunirvan\Desktop\Deepanshu\DistrictD\DemoData\audio\audio_1696249517_136.wav,224042,capex plan so don't alter for for the asset like green hydrogen three million
42,C:\Users\deepanshunirvan\Desktop\Deepanshu\DistrictD\DemoData\audio\audio_1696249517_137.wav,224042,facility approximately fifty billion dollars as we outlined earlier previously year
43,C:\Users\deepanshunirvan\Desktop\Deepanshu\DistrictD\DemoData\audio\audio_1696249517_138.wav,224042,so that plan continues afford as it is which will be
44,C:\Users\deepanshunirvan\Desktop\Deepanshu\DistrictD\DemoData\audio\audio_1696249517_139.wav,224042,which showed so this year we would touch about
45,C:\Users\deepanshunirvan\Desktop\Deepanshu\DistrictD\DemoData\audio\audio_1696249517_14.wav,224042,as you know aes business portfolio comprises both established and incubating assets spread across
46,C:\Users\deepanshunirvan\Desktop\Deepanshu\DistrictD\DemoData\audio\audio_1696249517_140.wav,224042,just about between three hundred million to four hundred million and then it rapidly
47,C:\Users\deepanshunirvan\Desktop\Deepanshu\DistrictD\DemoData\audio\audio_1696249517_141.wav,224042,start sizing from next year and the year after on the airport side we will have about
48,C:\Users\deepanshunirvan\Desktop\Deepanshu\DistrictD\DemoData\audio\audio_1696249517_142.wav,224042,this year just about one point one billion us dollars all of these just to clarify i we are assuming eighty
49,C:\Users\deepanshunirvan\Desktop\Deepanshu\DistrictD\DemoData\audio\audio_1696249517_143.wav,224042,rupees to a dollar rate but adjust for that but so about one point one billion us dollar this
50,C:\Users\deepanshunirvan\Desktop\Deepanshu\DistrictD\DemoData\audio\audio_1696249517_144.wav,224042,be the capex on airport will broadly remain in that range for the next years and then
51,C:\Users\deepanshunirvan\Desktop\Deepanshu\DistrictD\DemoData\audio\audio_1696249517_145.wav,224042,they would be a decline once we complete the first phase of our development plan in airports

57,C:\Users\deepanshunirvan\Desktop\Deepanshu\DistrictD\DemoData\audio\audio_1696249517_150.wav,224042,asking the question is what production has fallen like ten percent y y so
58,C:\Users\deepanshunirvan\Desktop\Deepanshu\DistrictD\DemoData\audio\audio_1696249517_151.wav,224042,can i please over to
59,C:\Users\deepanshunirvan\Desktop\Deepanshu\DistrictD\DemoData\audio\audio_1696249517_152.wav,224042,so i got the first tell of i'm not getting getting able to get the talk
60,C:\Users\deepanshunirvan\Desktop\Deepanshu\DistrictD\DemoData\audio\audio_1696249517_153.wav,224042,for voice phone so as for your first question is about the commercial mind we
61,C:\Users\deepanshunirvan\Desktop\Deepanshu\DistrictD\DemoData\audio\audio_1696249517_154.wav,224042,ugly hopeful of starting the open third in the ruby mine which is
62,C:\Users\deepanshunirvan\Desktop\Deepanshu\DistrictD\DemoData\audio\audio_1696249517_155.wav,224042,the commercial mine in this financial year we have already got the ec permission we are hopeful to get both
63,C:\Users\deepanshunirvan\Desktop\Deepanshu\DistrictD\DemoData\audio\audio_1696249517_156.wav,224042,fc fc tail the phase two and as as soon as we get stage two we should be pushing to
64,C:\Users\deepanshunirvan\Desktop\Deepanshu\DistrictD\DemoData\audio\audio_1696249517_157.wav,224042,with the box cutting mine all other mines be bi john or grand or
65,C:\Users\deepanshunirvan\Desktop\Deepanshu\DistrictD\DemoData\audio\audio_1696249517_158.wav,224042,gpu it'll take some time because out of seven four are actually underground mine so they'll take some
66,C:\Users\deepanshunirvan\Desktop\Deepanshu\DistrictD\DemoData\audio\audio_1696249517_159.wav,224042,time to to go for the preparation you have to prepare for sharp incline and then if
